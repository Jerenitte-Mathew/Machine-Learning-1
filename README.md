**World Happiness Report 2024 Analysis** 

Built a predictive model for Happiness Score using machine learning regression techniques, conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, preprocessing, and created visualizations.

**The “Multiple Linear Regression” model performs better overall than the polynomial regression model, as evidenced by its higher R², lower MSE, RMSE, and MAE values.**
                     
Multiple Linear model's performance metrics indicate an R-squared score of 0.8415, the model explains a significant portion of the variance in the target variable. The high Score Accuracy Rate and Adjusted R-squared suggest that the model explains a substantial proportion of the variance in happiness scores indicating that adding polynomial terms did not improve the model’s performance and may have even introduced unnecessary complexity, leading to overfitting. Overall, these metrics collectively demonstrate that Multiple Linear regression model is well-fitted and performs effectively in predicting happiness scores. Additionally, the MSE, RMSE and MAE values are relatively low, indicating that the model's predictions are close to the actual values on average.
